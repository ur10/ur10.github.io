This post will describe my work on the modeling, control and trajectory planning of AUV as part of my final year capstone project.

## AUV Control

### About AUV

An Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) is a free-swimming, Â self-propelled, unmanned, untethered underwater vehicle capable of carrying out simple activities with little or no human supervision.
AUVs are often used as survey platforms to map the seafloor or characterize physical, chemical, or biological properties of the water. A large variety of AUVs are in existence, ranging from vehicles weighing tens of kilograms, to vehicles weighing thousands of kilograms. Motivations for employing AUVs range from the ability to obtain superior data quality, for example, obtaining high-resolution maps of the deep seafloor, or to establish a pervasive ocean presence, for example, using many small AUVs to observe oceanographic fields.

### AUV Dynamics - 

The dynamic equation of an AUV is given by - 

$M_{FB}\dot{v} + C_{FB})(v)v + g_{FB} + D_{FB}(v)v = \tau$
Where- 
- $M_{FB}$ is the inertia of the ROV with the added mass.

- $C_{FB}$ is the coriolis force that can be ignored for our case.

- $g_{FB}$ is the gravity plus buoyancy force on the ROVin the frame of the ROV fixed body

- $D_{FB}(v)v$ is the drag force that is due to the viscosity if the liquid. It is given by -
$
1/2 * \rho * U^2 * S * C_d = F_d
$

- $C_d$ is the coefficient of dynamic damping that needs to be determined experimentally

- $S$ is the area projected perpendicular to the body velocity.

### State space equation formulation of the AUV - 

$$
\eta_1 = 
\left(\begin{array}{c} 
 x\\
 y \\
 z
\end{array}\right)
$$ 

$$
v_1 = 
\left(\begin{array}{c} 
 u\\
 v \\
 w
\end{array}\right)
$$ 


The transformation from the earth-fixed frame to the body fixed frame is given by -

$\dot{\eta_1} = R_B^1 *  v_1$

where $R_B^1$ is the rotation matrix for transforming the coordinates.


Similarly for the roll, pitch and yaw 

$v_2 = J_{K,O}(\eta_2) * \dot{\eta_2}$

Here, $J_{K,O}$ is the jacobian of $\eta_2$ for transformation to the body fixed frame.

From above the dynamics of the AUV can be given as - 

$\dot{\eta} = J_\theta(\eta)*v$


$M\dot{v} + C(v)v + D*V + g_\eta + g_o = \tau$

where ,
 $\eta  = [N,E,D,\phi.\theta,\psi]$

and,
 $V = [u,v,w,p,q,r]$

### Input thrust matrix formation - 

For our implementation of the AUV model, we will be considering motion along 4 DOFs. N,E,D and the yaw.

The input distribution matrix is given by - 

$$
I = 
\left(\begin{array}{cccccc} 
\\ 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0  \\
 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0  \\
 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
 \\ l & -l & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 
 \end{array}\right)
$$

ADD IMAGE OF INPUT THRUST 

```
if (_sdf->HasElement("topic"))
{
  topic = transport::TopicUtils::AsValidTopic(
      _sdf->Get<std::string>("topic"));

  if (topic.empty())
  {
    ignerr << "Failed to create topic [" << _sdf->Get<std::string>("topic")
           << "]" << " for joint [" << jointName
           << "]" << std::endl;
    return;
  }
}
```
