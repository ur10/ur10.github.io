			<p align="center">Hello! My name is Shanice Smith, I'm 20 years old and I'm a native New Yorker. I have several years of experience coding Front-End and Back-End using different languages, such as HTML/CSS, C#, C++ and Java. I gathered interest in programming when I began high school. I was on the Computer Science track, which meant I was taking programming courses daily through the period I was enrolled. During the three years I was a high school student, I've learned App Inventor for Andriod, C# and Java, documenting my weekly assignments each semester on Google Sites. I wasn't sure what I could do with a career with Computer Science at the time, but I knew I was excited to see something I created in real time. I was eager to learn new concepts and develop more dynamic projects with these new technologies. I was encouraged to seek out Hackathons during my Junior year by my Java teacher, and I was able to win first place with my all-female team at my second one a few months later! From there on, I knew I wanted to pursue Computer Programming professionally.
			<br><br>I'm currently attending LaGuardia Community College, obtaining an Associate's degree in Game Development. Aftering graduation, I plan on transferring to a four-year CUNY school in Fall 2019 to study Computer Science or Media Studies/Game Development. I'm actively involved in a number of extracurricular activities, such as Women in Technology club, G.R.A.C.E. Women Empowerment program, America Needs You Fellowship and volunteering at the LGBTQIA Safe Zone Hub & Women's Center on campus. I'm looking to become a club officer in the Spring semester for WiT and also obtain a summer internship in Engineering or Game Development in Summer 2019. Hopefully, in the next couple of years, I'll be in an Engineering or Game Dev role where I'm passionate about my projects and using my platforn to inspire young women and underrepresented minorities like myself to study STEM subjects.</p>
