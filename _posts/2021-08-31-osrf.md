This post will describe my work on the modeling, control and trajectory planning of AUV as part of my final year capstone project.

## AUV Control

### About AUV

An Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) is a free-swimming, Â self-propelled, unmanned, untethered underwater vehicle capable of carrying out simple activities with little or no human supervision.
AUVs are often used as survey platforms to map the seafloor or characterize physical, chemical, or biological properties of the water. A large variety of AUVs are in existence, ranging from vehicles weighing tens of kilograms, to vehicles weighing thousands of kilograms. Motivations for employing AUVs range from the ability to obtain superior data quality, for example, obtaining high-resolution maps of the deep seafloor, or to establish a pervasive ocean presence, for example, using many small AUVs to observe oceanographic fields.

### Modifying light intensity

Adds the ability to change the intensity of light entities in the simulation at runtime.

### Joint Position Controller topic validity

Sanity checks for user provided topic values in joint controllers.

Pull requests - [https://github.com/ignitionrobotics/ign-gazebo/pull/632](https://github.com/ignitionrobotics/ign-gazebo/pull/632) and [https://github.com/ignitionrobotics/ign-gazebo/pull/639](https://github.com/ignitionrobotics/ign-gazebo/pull/639)

```
if (_sdf->HasElement("topic"))
{
  topic = transport::TopicUtils::AsValidTopic(
      _sdf->Get<std::string>("topic"));

  if (topic.empty())
  {
    ignerr << "Failed to create topic [" << _sdf->Get<std::string>("topic")
           << "]" << " for joint [" << jointName
           << "]" << std::endl;
    return;
  }
}
```

## Ignition RViz

### TF transform status

Adds the ability to show TF transform status in RViz.

Pull request - [https://github.com/ignitionrobotics/ign-rviz/pull/69](https://github.com/ignitionrobotics/ign-rviz/pull/69)

|TF Warn | TF Error | TF Valid |
| ----------- | ----------- | ---------- |

### Bug fix in RViz FrameManager

Fixes a bug where RViz won't show entites in the absence of tf data.

Pull request - [https://github.com/ignitionrobotics/ign-rviz/pull/67](https://github.com/ignitionrobotics/ign-rviz/pull/67)
